## Linear Regression: 

In this folder, there are two main source code files:
  * StockPrediction.py
  * LinearRegressionAlgorithm.py

### <ins>StockPrediction.py</ins>

In this program, I used a scikit-learn Linear Regression model to predict Google Stock prices. 

#### Dataset:
I used python's **Quandl** module to import a real life **Google Stock prices** dataset from the core financial datasets on the **Nasdaq Data Link** website. 
The dataset contains Google stock prices from **08-19-2004** up to **03-27-2018** 

For simplicity reasons I will only include the first five lines of the dataset in the accompanying images. 

This is how the dataset initially looked like:
