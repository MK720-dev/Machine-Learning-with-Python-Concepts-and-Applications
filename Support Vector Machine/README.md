SVM is a binary classifier 
It seperates only into two groups at a time 
The goal of an SVM is to find the best separating hyperplane. 
The hyperplane could also be referred to as a decision boundary.
In the case of 2D dataset, the hyperplane will just be a line. 
The best separating hyperplane is the one who provides us with the largest distance between the actual hyperplane and the data it is separating. 
Once you acquire the best hyperplane, you can take in unkown data. The unkown would be classified depending on what side of the decision boundary it is on. 
In the case of a 2D dataset, a line would work best with a linear decision boundary (i.e. a line). If the dataset is nonlinear we will have to opt for a nonlinear function as our decision boundary.

One of the major downsides of svm is scaling just like K Nearest Neighbors 
One of its major upsides thos is that once you have trained an svm you don't need the old features anymore
